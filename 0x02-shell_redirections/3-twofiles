cat /etc/passwd,hosts
This code uses the cat command to display the contents of both the /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts files, with an additional section header.

Step 3: Save the file and exit the text editor.

Step 4: Make the file executable by running the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x 3-twofiles
Step 5: Now, you can run the script by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
./3-twofiles
This will display the content of both the /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts files, separated by the section header.

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the files.
